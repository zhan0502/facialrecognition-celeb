# CelebA Facial Attribute Recognition  

The objective of this project is to identify the attribute label depicted in the images from Celeb dataset [1]. The dataset consists of around160,000 images for training, around 20,000 images for validation and the remaining is for testing. In this project, we use only the training and validation dataset for model training and selection, and use the private dataset to infer attribute labels. I will present the used model, loss functions, data pre-processing method and bag of training tricks, as well as experimental results.
